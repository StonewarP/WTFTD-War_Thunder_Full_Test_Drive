"""Test bench: what an aircraft really does, measured in the game. The player flies a guided test in a mission WTFTD wrote,
the recording (flightlog.py) goes through analyse(), which keeps the stretches that make a valid run and says why it
refused the others. Results are in user/bench.json, by aircraft, loadout and game version. UI in web/bench.js.

The player flies: nothing here sends anything to the game, the app only reads port 8111 through alarms.Watch. A number
in a result is read from the game or is plain geometry of what was read (a turn's radius: the distance flown in 360°);
what the flight model says it should be is never a measurement here.

Tests: top speed, climb, sustained turn, acceleration, speed lost in a hard turn, slowest level flight at idle. Helicopters
get the first three that fit them (top, climb, accel): they have no stall, and a hard turn's numbers mean nothing without
a throttle to hold. The stall test measures where level flight stops, not the wing's stall: with the game's instructor
on, the nose never drops, but the aircraft does sink.

The file can be edited by hand and a plan comes from the page: both go through clean()."""
